## Javascript

### What is javascript?

JavaScript often abbreviated as `JS`, is a `high-level`, `interpreted programming` language. It is a language which is also characterized as `dynamic`, `weakly typed`, `prototype-based` and `multi-paradigm`.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the `World Wide Web`. JavaScript enables `interactive` web pages and this is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all `major web browsers` have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a `multi-paradigm` language, JavaScript supports `event-driven`, `functional`, and imperative (including `object-oriented` and `prototype-based`) programming styles. It has an API for working with `text`, `arrays`, `dates`, `regular expressions`, and `basic manipulation` of the `DOM`, but the language itself does not include any `I/O`, such as `networking`, `storage`, or `graphics` `facilities`, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

## Node JS

### What is node.js?

A `JavaScript runtime` built on `Chrome's V8` JavaScript `engine`. Node.js is an `asynchronous` `event driven`. It is designed to build `scalable` network applications. The `architecture` design has been influenced by, systems like `Ruby's Event Machine` or `Python's Twisted`. The event model presents an `event loop` as a runtime construct instead of as a library. It is designed without `threads`, doesn't mean you cannot take advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned by using our `child_process.fork()` API, and are designed to be easy to communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the `cluster` module, which allows you to share `sockets` between processes to enable `load balancing` over your cores.

### What is react.js?

React is a `declarative`, `efficient`, and `flexible` JavaScript `library` for building `user interfaces`. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called `“components”`

## Typescript

### What is typescript?

`TypeScript` is a language for `application-scale` JavaScript. TypeScript adds `optional types`, `classes`, and `modules` to JavaScript. TypeScript supports tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for `any browser`, for `any host`, on `any OS`. TypeScript compiles to `readable`, `standards-based` JavaScript. [see more](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
