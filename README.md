## Javascript

### What is javascript?

JavaScript often abbreviated as `JS`, is a `high-level`, `interpreted programming language`. It is a language which is also characterized as `dynamic`, `weakly typed`, `prototype-based` and `multi-paradigm`.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the `World Wide Web`. JavaScript enables `interactive` web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all `major web browsers` have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a `multi-paradigm` language, JavaScript supports `event-driven`, `functional`, and imperative (including `object-oriented` and `prototype-based`) programming styles. It has an API for working with `text`, `arrays`, `dates`, `regular expressions`, and `basic manipulation of the DOM`, but the language itself does not include any `I/O`, such as `networking`, `storage`, or `graphics` `facilities`, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
